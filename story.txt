I woke up at 6:00 AM.
"5 more minutes," I said.
I woke up again, but it was 6:30.
I got out of bed and got dressed.
Then I went downstairs and had cereal for breakfast.
At 7:00 AM, I left for school.
It took me 23 minutes to walk to school.
I went to my locker.
I went to Algebra, my first period.
At 11:35 AM, I went to lunch.
